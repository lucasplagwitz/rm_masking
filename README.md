### Rat-Mouse Brain Masking with U-Net

This project demonstrates the application of the U-Net architecture for masking mouse and rat brains. 
It focuses on:
1. the possibility/necessity of transfer-learning from mouse to rat,
2. an analysis of required training data size, and
3. providing a Nifti in-out brain masker.

The code and net structure is inspired by a [PyTorch U-Net implementation](https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet).
The training process of the model will be added in one of the next versions.

### Installation

- Activate the Anaconda environment if available. 
- If git is missing: install it via ```conda install -c anaconda git```
- Install the package with ```pip install git+https://github.com/lucasplagwitz/rm_masking.git```.
- Start the transformation with ```python -c "from rm_masking import predict; predict.run(r'/path/to/input_niis/', r'/path/to/output_niis/')"```
